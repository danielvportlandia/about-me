        <img src='img/rustic-horse-scenery.jpg' alt='Scenic shot of rural Oregon with a horse in the background' title='scenic shot of horse'/>I was born in Portland, Oregon but raised near the Flying M Ranch in rural Yamhill County. The Flying M Ranch was known for their rustic lodging, horseback trails, and their airstrip where pilots would fly in from all around for Sunday brunch.
